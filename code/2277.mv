# if else - compare two characters
# Read two characters, output '1' if same, '0' if different
A<I
B<I
# Subtract to check if equal
C<A
D<B
E<1
# Check if A==B by subtracting and checking if result is 0
# Since we can't do arithmetic directly, we'll use a different approach
# We'll compare bit by bit or use lookup
# Actually, simpler: output '1' (ASCII 49) if A==B, else '0' (ASCII 48)
# A==B means A-B == 0, but we can't subtract
# Let's use memory as a flag array
# Set mem[A] = 1, check mem[B]
[A]<1
F<[B]
# If F==1, they're equal, output '1' (49), else output '0' (48)
# We need conditional execution... but mov only has mov
# Use arithmetic: output = 48 + F
G<48
H<G
# If F==1, add 1 to get 49
# We can't add directly, so we need to use memory/lookup
# Let me use a lookup table approach
# Store 48 at position 0, store 49 at position 1
[0]<48
[1]<49
O<[F]
Z<1
